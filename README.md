# laban-js

This open source project is part of [The Global hack](https://theglobalhack.com/) online-event. For information about current state of coding please look [project wiki](https://github.com/matyushkin/laban-js/wiki).

## Inspiration
The coronavirus pandemic caused people to isolate themselves. A long stay at home causes a problem of low mobility, physical and mental health weakness. Physical exercises could help in this matter. However, the uniformity of exercises in a confined space can also adversely affect the mental state. Unlike fitness and other usual physical activities, dance improvisation involves research work aimed at studying the relationships in the body. One square meter is required for the lessons.

## What it does
The program uses the improvisation method by [Rudolf von Laban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_von_Laban) to introduce a person to his body. The user enters three parameters or uses randomly generated ones corresponding to the level of experience with the system. Further, the system composes a personal training program for him and displays in the form of audio commands that the user can perform in his own improvisational style.

Three input-forms represent the input data: 1) a combination of codes from Laban system (a string of numbers), 2) the number of repetitions), 3) delay time in seconds for rest between dance actions. A button under these forms controls the output. When you click on the button, the audiofiles sequence starts to play. This audio files are comands ot a virtual trainer.

Short YouTube video to understand what Laban Movement System is:

## How we built it
Using a popular programming language will allow other contributors to join the writing of open source software.
As a result of work on the project, we want to get a ready-made working application
that will generate the necessary sequence of actions for dance improvisation controlled by a speech synthesizer.
Now the [original program](https://github.com/techandtech/laban) is only available on the local computer as a console application. The task is to create a web site to make it available to other people. Now we use only HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make demo-application on website. 

## What's next for Laban
First of all, we want to finish what we did not manage to correctly implement in the current representation of the site: JavaScript code (with frameworks instead of pure JS) and design. Next, we want to provide the site with instructions in more detail so that it should be clear what someone can to do using the site: more examples of movements for people with different backgrounds. When we have a good presentation of the site, we want to add the ability for users to save information about their dances, to make it like a game with awards. In order to make the process even more interesting, we will expand the functionality of the site with other dance improvisation techniques and exercises, so that visitors will have a choice. 

## What kind of impact are you expecting to have with this solution?
We want people to become more physically and mentally healthy. This is especially important now. A physically unprepared body has poor immunity, and so many people do not like physical exercise because of their uniformity. Even those who do not like physical exercises can perceive Laban technique as entertainment with useful consequences for their well-being. Indeed, for their implementation, only one square meter is enough. We want to create such a system so that users participate in challenges related to the funny dance performance improvisation, communicate through the dance, get acquainted with their own body. Despite the fact that this happens at a distance from each other, people will be closer to each other mentally.
